# IPL_PREDICTION_ANALYSIS-
 Machine Learning model to predict IPL first innings scores using Python and Scikit-learn — applying regression and data analytics to real match data.”
 
🏏 About the Project

Cricket is unpredictable — but with machine learning, we can make some smart guesses! 😉
This project focuses on predicting the first innings score in IPL (Indian Premier League) matches using real-time match data such as runs, overs, wickets, and current run rate.

The model analyzes historical IPL datasets and applies multiple regression algorithms to estimate the final score based on the match’s current situation. By comparing models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, this project identifies the most accurate approach for sports data prediction.

🎯 Project Objectives

Build a predictive model for IPL first innings total using ML algorithms.

Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA on IPL datasets.

Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like R² and RMSE.

Visualize results for insights into scoring trends and team performance.

🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

⚡ Results

Achieved high prediction accuracy using ensemble regression models.
